    "### 采访金句和核心观点\n",
    "\n",
    "- Everything starts with the question: What is the research question?\n",
    "- Science has not provided us with the mathematics to capture the idea of x causes y and y does not cause x. Because all the question of physics are symmetrical, algebraic. The equality sign goes both ways.\n",
    "- We start by asking ourselves question: what are the factors that would determine the value of x?\n",
    "- AI slogan is presentation first, discovery second.\n",
    "- They need the human expert to specify the initial model. **Initial model could be very qualitative. Just who listens to whom?** By whom listens I mean one variable listens to the other.\n",
    "- it's a difficult question because it's: find the cause from effect. The easy one is find effect from cause. \n",
    "- I'm working only in the abstract. The abstract is knowledge in, knowledge out, data in between.\n",
    "- All our life, all our intelligence, is built around metaphors, **mapping from the unfamiliar to the familiar, but the marriage between the two is a tough thing, which we haven't yet been able to algorithmatize.**\n",
    "- All do-calculus is logical relationships, a powerful generalization of **boolean logic**.\n",
    "- The end goal is going to be a machine that can answer sophisticated questions: counterfactuals, regret, compassion, responsibility, and free will. \n",
    "- For me, **consciousness is having a blueprint of your software.**\n",
    "\n",
    "关于专家系统 with causation。You have to start with some knowledge, and you're trying to enrich it. But you don't enrich it by asking for more rules. You enrich it by asking for the data. To look at the data, and quantifying, and ask queries that you couldn't answer when you started. You couldn't because the question is quite complex, and it's not within the capability of ordinary cognition, of ordinary person, ordinary expert even, to answer\n",
    "\n",
    "关于因果连接多少的影响。 The more arrow you add, the less likely you are to identify things from purely observational data. So if the whole world is bushy, and everybody effect everybody else, the answer is-you can answer it ahead of time. I cannot answer my query from observational data. I have to go to experiments(因果连接越多越不可预测).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "关于反事实的解释和意义。You have a clash, **a logical clash, that cannot exist together**. That's counterfactual, and that is the source of our explanation of the idea of responsibility, regret, and free will. \n",
    "\n",
    "婴儿如何建立因果模型。 That's another question: How do the babies come out with the counterfactual model of the world? And babies do that. They know how to play in the crib. They know which balls hits another one, and they learn it by playful manipulation of the world. Their simple world involves all these toys and balls and chimes (laughs) but if you think about it, it's a complex world. [Lex]We take for granted how complicated-- And the kids do it by playful manipulation, plus parent guidance, peer wisdom, and hearsay. They meet each other, and they say, \"You shouldn't have taken my toy.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "（如何构建因果图？）Now, can we take a leap to trying to learn, when it's not 20 variables but 20 million variables, trying to learn causation in this world. Not learn, but somehow construct models. I mean, it seems like you would only have to be able to learn, because constructing it manually would be too difficult. Do you have ideas of-- \n",
    "**I think it's a matter of combining simple models from many, many sources, from many, many disciplines. And many metaphors.** Metaphors is an expert system. It's mapping problem with which you are not familiar, to a problem with which you are familiar. All our life, all our intelligence, is built around metaphors, **mapping from the unfamiliar to the familiar, but the marriage between the two is a tough thing, which we haven't yet been able to algorithmatize.**\n",
    "\n",
    "（因果和自由意志，意识等）I have a blueprint of myself, though, not a full detail, though, because I cannot get the whole thing problem, but I have a blueprint. So at that level of a blueprint, I can modify things. I can look at myself in the mirror and say, \"Hmm, if I tweak this model, \"I'm going to perform differently.\" That is what we mean by free will. For me, **consciousness is having a blueprint of your software.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "（墓志铭怎么写？）I already have a tombstone carved. (both laugh) Oh, boy. The fundamental law of counterfactuals. That's what it-it's a simple equation. Put a counterfactual in terms of a model surgery. That's it, because everything follows from there. If you get that, all the rest. I can die in peace, and my student can derive all my knowledge by mathematical means. The rest follows."

    "The following is a conversion with Judea Pearl, professor at UCLA and a winner of the Turing Award, that's generally recognized as the Nobel Prize of computing. He's one of the seminal figures in the field of artificial intelligence, computer science, and statistics. He has developed and championed probabilistic approaches to AI, including Bayesian networks, and profound ideas in causality in general. These ideas are important not just to AI,  but to our understanding and practice of science.\n",

Oh, maybe, no, actually I should say it's 2,000 years old, because we have this experiment by Daniel, about the Babylonian king, that wanted the exiled people from Israel, that were taken in exile to Babylon to serve the king. He wanted to serve them king's food, which was meat, and Daniel as a good Jew couldn't eat non-Kosher food, so he asked them to eat vegetarian food. But the king's overseers said, \"I'm sorry, \"but if the king sees that your performance falls \"below that of other kids, now, he's going to kill me.\" Daniel said, \"Let's make an experiment. \"Let's take four of us from Jerusalem, okay? \"Give us vegetarian food. \"Let's take the other guys to eat the king's food, \"and about a week's time, we'll test our performance.\" And you know the answer, because he did the experiment, and they were so much better than the others, that the kings nominated them to super positions, (laughs) in his case, so it was a first experiment. So that there was a very simple, it's also the same research questions. We want to know if vegetarian food assists or obstructs your mental ability. So, the question is a very old one. Even Democritus, if I could discover one cause of things, I would rather discuss one cause than be King of Persia. The task of discovering causes was in the mind of ancient people from many, many years ago. But, the mathematics of doing that was only developed in the 1920s. So, science has left us orphaned. **Science has not provided us with the mathematics to capture the idea of x causes y and y does not cause x.

It had a conflict here, or clash between observed fact -he did shoot, okay -- and the hypothetical predicate, which says, had he not shot. You have a clash, **a logical clash, that cannot exist together**. That's counterfactual, and that is the source of our explanation of the idea of responsibility, regret, and free will. "

In every equation of physics, you have Hooke's law, and you put one kilogram on the spring, and the spring is one meter, and you say, \"Had this weight been two kilograms, \"the spring would have been twice as long.\" It's not a problem for physicists to say that. Instead with mathematics, it is in the form of an equation, equating the weight, proportionality constant, and the length of the spring. We don't have the assymetry in the equation of physics, although every physicist thinks counterfactually. Ask high school kids, had the weight been three kilograms, what would be the length of the spring?

    "**I think it's a matter of combining simple models from many, many sources, from many, many disciplines. And many metaphors.**  Metaphors are the basis of human intelligence. [Lex]Yeah, so how do you think about a metaphor in terms of its use in human intelligence? [Judea] Metaphors is an expert system. It's mapping problem with which you are not familiar, to a problem with which you are familiar. Like I give you a great example. The Greek believed that the sky is an opaque sheer. It's not really infinite space; it's an opaque sheer, and the stars are holes poked in the sheer, through which you see the eternal light. It was a metaphor, why? Because they understand how you poke holes in sheers. They were not familiar with infinite space. And we are walking on a shell of a turtle, and if you get too close to the edge, you're going to fall down to Hades, or wherever, yeah. That's a metaphor. It's not true. But these kind of metaphor enabled Eratosthenes to measure the radius of the Earth, because he said, \"Come on. \"If we are walking on a turtle shell, \"then the ray of light coming to this place \"will be different angle than coming to this place. \"I know the distance. \"I'll measure the two angles, \"and then I have the radius of the shell of the turtle.\" And he did. And his measurement was very close to the measurements we have today. It was, what, 6,700 kilometers, was the Earth? That's something that would not occur to a Babylonian astronomer, even though the Babylonian experiments were the machine learning people of the time. They fit curves, and they could predict the eclipse of the moon much more accurately than the Greek, because they fit curves. That's a different metaphor, something that you're familiar with, again, a turtle shell. What does it mean, if you are familiar? **Familiar means that answers to certain questions are explicit.** You don't have to derive them.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Lex]And they were made explicit because somewhere in the past you've constructed a model of that-- [Judea]You're familiar with, so the child is familiar with billiard balls. So the child could predict that if you let loose of one ball, the other one will bounce off. You attain that by familiarity. Familiarity is answering questions, and you store the answer explicitly. You don't have to derive it. So this is idea for metaphor. All our life, all our intelligence, is built around metaphors, **mapping from the unfamiliar to the familiar, but the marriage between the two is a tough thing, which we haven't yet been able to algorithmatize.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[Lex]So, you think of that process of using metaphor to leap from one place to another. We can call it reasoning. Is it a kind of reasoning? [Judea] It is a reasoning by metaphor, but-- Reasoning by metaphor. [Lex]Do you think of that as learning? So, learning is a popular terminology today in a narrow sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Judea] It is, it is definitely. So you may not-you're right. It's one of the most important learning, taking something which theoretically is derivable, and store it in accessible format. I'll give you an example: chess, okay? Finding the winning starting move in chess is hard. But there is an answer. Either there is a winning move for white, or there isn't, or it is a draw. So, the answer to that is available through the rule of the game. But we don't know the answer. So what does a chess master have that we don't have? He has stored explicitly an evaluation of certain complex pattern of the board. We don't have it, ordinary people, like me. I don't know about you. I'm not a chess master. So for me I have to derive things that for him is explicit. He has seen it before, or he has seen the pattern before, or similar patterns before, and he generalizes, and says, \"Don't move; it's a dangerous move.\" "

We don't understand it. I just listened recently to what they teach you in Mogadishu. (laughs) When the war does stop, and the tap, we knew exactly who did it. The Jews. [Lex] The Jews. We didn't know how, but we knew who did it. We don't appreciate what it means to us. The depth is unbelievable. Do you think all of us are capable of evil, and the education, the indoctrination, is really what creates evil? Absolutely we are capable of evil. If you are indoctrinated sufficiently long, and in depth, we are capable of ISIS, we are capable of Nazism, yes, we are. But the question is whether we, after we have gone through some Western education, and we learn that everything is really relative, that there is no absolute God. He's only a belief in God. Whether we are capable, now, of being transformed, under certain circumstances, to become brutal. [Lex] Yeah. That is a qu-I'm worried about it, because some people say yes, given the right circumstances, given the bad economical crisis. You are capable of doing it, too, and that worries me. I want to believe that I'm not capable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Seven years after Daniel's death, you wrote an article at the Wall Street Journal titled \"Daniel Pearl and the Normalization of Evil.\" [Judea] Yes. What was your message back then, and how did it change today, over the years? I lost. [Lex] What was the message? The message was that we are not treating terrorism as a taboo. We are treating it as a bargaining device that is accepted. People have grievance, and they go and bomb restaurants. It's normal. Look, you're even not surprised when I tell you that. Twenty years ago you say, \"What? For grievance you go \"and blow a restaurant?\" Today it's become normalized. The banalisation of evil. And we have created that to ourselves, by normalizing it, by making it part of political life. It's a political debate. Every terrorist yesterday becomes a freedom fighter today and tomorrow is become a terrorist again. It's switchable. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Lex] And so, we should call out evil when there's evil. If we don't want to be part of it. [Lex] Become it. Yeah, if we want to separate good from evil, that's one of the first things, that, in the Garden of Eden, remember? The first thing that God tells them was \"Hey, you want some knowledge? \"Here is the tree of good and evil.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "So this evil touched your life personally. Does your heart have anger, sadness, or is it hope? Look, I see some beautiful people coming from Pakistan. I see beautiful people everywhere. But I see horrible propagation of evil in this country, too. It shows you how populistic slogans can catch the mind of the best intellectuals. Today is Father's Day. [Judea] I didn't know that. Yeah, what's a fond memory you have of Daniel? Oh, many good memories remains. He was my mentor. He had a sense of balance that I didn't have. (laughs) [Lex] Yeah. He saw the beauty in every person. He was not as emotional as I am, more looking things in perspective. He really liked every person. He really grew up with the idea that a foreigner is a reason for curiosity, not for fear. This one time we went in Berkeley, and a homeless came out from some dark alley and said, \"Hey man, can you spare a dime?\" (Judea gasps) I retreated back, you know, two feet back, and Danny just hugged him and say \"Here's a dime. \"Enjoy yourself. Maybe you want some money to take a bus \"or whatever.\" Where did he get it? Not from me. "

    "Q25. （对他人的建议？） Do you have advice for young minds today dreaming about creating, as you have dreamt, creating intelligent systems? What is the best way to arrive at new break-through ideas and carry them through the fire of criticism and past conventional ideas? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ask your questions. Really, your questions are never dumb. And solve them your own way. (laughs) And don't take \"no\" for an answer. If they're really dumb, you'll find out quickly, by trial and error, to see that they're not leading any place. But follow them, and try to understand things your way. That is my advice. I don't know if it's going to help anyone. [Lex] No, that's brilliantly put. There's a lot of inertia in science, in academia. It is slowing down science. Yeah, those two words, \"your way,\" that's a powerful thing. It's against inertia, potentially. [Judea] **Against your professor.** (Lex laughs) I wrote \"The Book of Why\" in order to democratize common sense. [Lex] Yeah. (laughs) In order to instill rebellious spirits in students, so they wouldn't wait until the professor gets things right. (both laugh) \n",

That's it, because everything follows from there. If you get that, all the rest. I can die in peace, and my student can derive all my knowledge by mathematical means. The rest follows. "

    "（主持人介绍 Judea Pearl。）hello, thank you everyone for coming in today. it's wonderful to have you all with us and this is the last keynote of the conference. this is my pleasure to introduce you to dr. Julia pearl, he's a Chancellor's emeritus professor at UCLA, and the winner of 2011 Turing Award, also considered the Nobel Prize of computing. he's best known for championing the probabilistic approach to artificial intelligence and the development of Bayesian networks, so I'm handing the mic now to Julia, give him a huge round of applause.\n",
    "\n",
    "（数据科学需要一种新的引擎来回答因果问题。）Thank you, thank you can you hear me, I'll try to be as concise as possible and convey to you the essence of my talk here in the very first slide. I have a proverb which I composed in the car service coming here. I think that was summarize it very clearly, my message is very simple \"it is the data is a window to reality and data science is a glass that enables us to look through the window, it is not a mirror through which data looks at itself under makeup that is the essence of things, which means the data science is a two-body science connects data in reality,   interpret reality in in view of the data.\" Well, you can say we all know that, so let's go and see what has been done with data science thus far, and my outline will be one why data science needs a new engine to answer causal questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "（我们天生就有因果思维）I call it a new engine because for us computer scientist a piece of software is an engine, and I call it a new engine because it is a new organ in our mind, one that has its own logic its own unique features, the one that we haven't even been aware that we have it, like a guy finds out one day that he has or she has liver we can live our life without knowing that we have a liver. But once we discover that the liver is there, and its function then it's the duty of the physician or the physiologist understand the function and to be able to repair it when it goes wrong. \n",
    "\n",
    "（因果推理的基本规律得出的SCM）So I'm gonna I'm gonna talk about the structure of this new engine. I don't want to keep on saying liver and **the two fundamental laws of causal inference**. You can look at it as a double helix, because once you see and you acquire and you commit yourself to these two fundamental laws, you don't have to listen to any lectures like this one you can do everything yourself it derive able mathematically. It's nice thing about science sometimes you get the key and the rest is derive a bull like the axioms of geometry, and then I'm gonna spend the second part of my talk convincing you that it is not just a mathematical gimmick but it has application。 \n",
    "\n",
    "（因果推理七个支柱）I will convey the applications through a list of seven pillars. These are tools that you will be able to do once you acquire the double helix and these are tools that go beyond data science tool that enables you to answer questions that ordinary statistics cannot, answer it ordinary machine learning cannot answer today. They will tomorrow and it has revolutionized data intensive sciences from epidemiology to economics to social science."
